You only began stepping through once the robot was already well inside, which can reduce control and spatial awareness at the threshold.\nstep 1: Keep up, stop one step behind robot at threshold.\nstep 2: Immediately step over threshold with short, confident steps.","Your main issues: you often stand too close at the doorway, and sometimes move up before the door is fully open. This makes it hard for the robot to adjust its position and increases the chance of bumping the door or frame.\n\nStep 1: When the robot pauses at the doorway\n- Keep feet still; don’t step closer.\n- Let your arm stretch; body stays back.\n- Aim for about one arm’s length gap.\n\nStep 2: Before you step into the doorway\n- Use free hand to swing door fully open.\n- Feel full swing: no hard stop near your body.\n- Only move when pull on handle feels steady.\n\n"

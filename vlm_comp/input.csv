This wastes time and can confuse the robotic guide dog’s position.\nstep 1: Shift right hand lower toward mid-door area.\nstep 2: Slide hand down to handle, grip, pull fully.""","You located the correct right-hand door, found the handle after some high searching, and opened it wide enough for passage. However, you stood very close to the door edge and left the robot slightly off-center, which could interfere with safe, efficient passage. step 1: After robot stops, step so shoulder aligns handle.\nstep 2: Sweep hand sideways at handle height, then pull while stepping back.","Main mistakes: you reached too high and drifted away from the real handle area, searching on the wall instead of near the door edge at handle height. This matches common failure: wrong region and wrong direction while searching. Try this instead:\n\nstep 1: Find door edge at arm’s length, mid‑body height.\nstep 2: Slide hand down a bit, then sideways to find handle."

However, you stayed quite close to the robot and hesitated on the threshold, sometimes standing on the ramp edge while the robot moved ahead. Increasing your following distance by about one step and committing to a smoother, continuous crossing once the robot has cleared the door will make the maneuver safer and more efficient. step 1: Increase following distance by one comfortable step.\nstep 2: Once robot clears threshold, walk through without pausing.","Main mistake: you crowded the robot at the doorway while holding the door, shrinking its space to adjust. This matches failure mode: being too close so you interfere with its pose changes.\n\nStep 1: At doors, stay half‑step behind threshold.\nStep 2: Keep arm’s‑length space; let robot adjust first."

This leads to inefficient task completion and could block the robot from passing through safely. Focus on committing to a single, continuous pull to fully open the door and stepping your body out of the doorway to create a clear path. step 1: After finding handle, keep holding and pull fully.\nstep 2: Step back and left, keeping doorway wide for robot.","You searched on the wrong wall area, stood misaligned from the door, and spent too long working the handle instead of one smooth open. Try to correct these with a simple fixed pattern.\nstep 1: Find the door edge first at arm’s reach.\nstep 2: Slide along edge, then slightly inward to find handle.\n"

This risks trapping or bumping the robot and makes the passage inefficient. Focus on maintaining a small gap behind the robot, staying centered in the doorway, and holding the door fully open until the robot is clearly clear of the doorway before closing it. step 1: After entering, pause; ensure robot is fully clear.\nstep 2: Keep door wide open; maintain half‑step gap behind robot.","You allowed the door to become almost closed again, and you stood too close to both the door and the robot during the doorway passage. This made the opening narrow and limited the robot’s ability to adjust its position.\n\nStep 1: Stand a bit further back from the doorway.\nStep 2: Open the door wider and keep it fully open"

This causes hesitation and potential interference with the robot’s path. step 1: After opening door, move forward past threshold together.\nstep 2: Keep a constant arm-length gap; avoid stopping or steering.","Your main issues: you often stand too close at the doorway, and sometimes move up before the door is fully open. This makes it hard for the robot to adjust its position and increases the chance of bumping the door or frame.\n\nStep 1: When the robot pauses at the doorway\n- Keep feet still; don’t step closer.\n- Let your arm stretch; body stays back.\n- Aim for about one arm’s length gap.\n\nStep 2: Before you step into the doorway\n- Use free hand to swing door fully open.\n- Feel full swing: no hard stop near your body.\n- Only move when pull on handle feels steady.\n\n"

With better stopping distance, door‑side positioning, and clearer space for the robot, the task will be safer and more efficient.step 1: Stop one step closer, then reach directly. step 2: Open fully, step back from hinge and door path.","Main mistake: you started your search too low on the door, near the vent area, instead of at typical handle height. This made you work harder and search longer than needed. Step 1: Start your search higher, around hip to chest height.

However, you consistently walked too close to the robot and the door edge, leaving limited space for the robot to adjust its path and increasing collision and pinching risk. Improving spacing and pausing to allow the robot to lead will make door transitions safer and smoother.step 1: Increase distance; let robot be one step ahead.\nstep 2: Open door fully, pause, then follow robot through.","Your main mistakes were following too closely at the doorway and moving while the door was only partly open.

However, your distance to the robot at the doorway was too close, reducing its ability to adjust its pose safely in the narrow entrance. Improving spacing and pausing to let the robot clear the threshold will make door passages safer and smoother. step 1: Increase gap; let robot clear doorway first.\nstep 2: Keep harness slightly extended; avoid crowding its rear.","You handled this doorway well; no major mistakes here.\n\nstep 1: Keep about one arm’s length behind the handle.\nstep 2: When you feel narrowing space, give the robot a half‑step more room."

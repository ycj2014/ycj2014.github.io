While holding the guide dog handle, extend your right hand to the right-front, slide it along the door surface until you feel the metal pull handle, then grasp the handle firmly.\n2. Step slightly back and to the left with the guide dog, then pull the handle toward you until the door is fully open and the passage is clear.","The user initially searches too high and on the flat door surface instead of going directly to the handle, but eventually locates the right-side pull handle and opens the restroom door wide while keeping the robot safely behind the swing path.\n\n1) From the stopping position beside the door, move your right hand downward toward the vertical metal handle (not the wall or upper door area), then firmly grasp the handle.\n2) Pull the handle toward you until the door is fully open and clear of the robot’s path, ensuring the robot remains behind the door swing area before proceeding.","Main mistakes: you reached too high and drifted away from the real handle area, searching on the wall instead of near the door edge at handle height. This matches common failure mode wrong region and wrong direction while searching. Try this instead:\n\nstep 1: Find door edge at arm’s length, mid‑body height.\nstep 2: Slide hand down a bit, then sideways to find handle."

Once the robot has fully entered the room, continue straight in behind it, allowing the door to swing closed behind you while maintaining safe distance from the walls and bathroom fixtures.""","When guiding the robot through the doorway, first use your free hand to fully secure and hold the door open using the grab bar, then reposition your body so you stand behind the robot and square to the threshold; this prevents you from being squeezed between the robot and the moving door and keeps the passage clear.\n2. After the door is fixed open, walk forward with the robot in a straight line across the threshold, watching your foot placement on the change in flooring height and keeping the leash short so the robot does not drift toward the door edge or wall, which could cause collisions or the robot to snag on the sill.","Main mistake: you crowded the robot at the doorway while holding the door, shrinking its space to adjust. This matches failure mode: being too close so you interfere with its pose changes.\n\nStep 1: At doors, stay half‑step behind threshold.\nStep 2: Keep arm’s‑length space; let robot adjust first."

With the robotic guide dog stopped, reach to the right-front wall, slide your hand along it until you feel the vertical metal handle, then grasp it firmly.\n2. Pull the handle toward you to swing the door fully open, step through while keeping hold of the guide dog, then release the handle once the doorway is clear.","The user initially searches on the flat door surface near the restroom sign and misses the handle, then later finds and holds the handle but only cracks the door open slightly, not wide enough for safe passage or the robot. 1) From your current position, slide your right hand down and slightly left until you firmly grasp the metal door handle; avoid feeling near the sign area where there is no handle. 2) Once holding the handle, take a small step back and pull the door steadily toward you until it opens wide enough for both you and the robot to pass through side‑by‑side, then proceed.","You made several mistakes: you searched on the wrong wall area, stood misaligned from the door, and spent too long working the handle instead of one smooth open. Try to correct these with a simple fixed pattern.\nstep 1: Find the door edge first at arm’s reach.\nstep 2: Slide along edge, then slightly inward to find handle.\n"

Keep your position directly behind the robotic guide dog and move straight forward through the doorway, staying centered in the opening and watching the small floor lip at the threshold.\n2. Once fully inside the restroom, stop beside the guide dog, allowing the door to close behind you without letting the robot or yourself contact the door or wall-mounted fixtures","The user successfully follows the robot into the accessible restroom but then focuses on closing the door and wall area instead of maintaining awareness of the robot’s final position. 1) Step fully into the room behind the robot, then stop when the robot stops and keep it centered in front of you, avoiding drifting toward the wall or door. 2) Once both you and the robot are well inside and clear of the doorway, use your right hand to reach for and pull the inside door handle closed while keeping track of the robot’s location ahead of you.""","Your main mistakes: you allowed the door to become almost closed again, and you stood too close to both the door and the robot during the doorway passage. This made the opening narrow and limited the robot’s ability to adjust its position.\n\nStep 1: Stand a bit further back from the doorway.\nStep 2: Open the door wider and keep it fully open"

Keep a light, steady hold on the guide stick, stay directly behind the robot, and walk forward as it moves, matching its speed while looking through the doorway and noting the floor transition. 2. As the robot fully enters the room, step over the threshold yourself, maintaining your distance behind it and letting the door swing back once you and the robot are clear of its path.","Summary: The user opens the restroom door with the right hand, then releases it and stands still at the threshold while the robot moves slowly into the room ahead. The user hesitates and lags behind instead of promptly stepping through and maintaining a consistent distance to the robot.\n\nStep 1: As soon as the doorway is clear, walk forward with small, confident steps, crossing the threshold immediately behind the robot so that its rear legs stay about one arm’s length in front of you.\nStep 2: Keep your focus on the robot’s body (not the door), allow it to lead you fully into the room, and stop only when the robot stops well inside, avoiding pausing or hovering at the doorway.\n\nWarnings/Issues: Hesitation at the threshold and letting the robot move too far ahead can cause loss of guidance or blocking the doorway; do not stay parked at the door once it is open","Your main issues: you often stand too close at the doorway, and sometimes move up before the door is fully open. This makes it hard for the robot to adjust its position and increases the chance of bumping the door or frame.\n\nStep 1: When the robot pauses at the doorway\n- Keep feet still; don’t step closer.\n- Let your arm stretch; body stays back.\n- Aim for about one arm’s length gap.\n\nStep 2: Before you step into the doorway\n- Use free hand to swing door fully open.\n- Feel full swing: no hard stop near your body.\n- Only move when pull on handle feels steady.\n\n"

You are initially reaching too low on the door (vent area) instead of the handle; raise your right hand slightly and grasp the vertical metal handle on the right side of the door, then pull it fully toward you to open the door wide.\n2. After the door is opened, stop stepping back; hold the handle steady with your right hand so the door stays maximally open, then guide the robot straight forward through the doorway while maintaining a safe gap from the door edge.","Main mistake: you started your search too low on the door, near the vent area, instead of at typical handle height. This made you work harder and search longer than needed. Step 1: Start your search higher, around hip to chest height. Step 2: From the door edge, sweep your hand forward and slightly right to find the handle. "

Keep a light, steady hold on the guide rod, align yourself directly behind the robot, and walk forward at its pace, keeping a small, consistent gap so it can lead through the doorway.\n2. As the robot crosses the threshold, step straight through behind it, ensuring your body and feet follow its path clear of the door edge, then continue into the room while maintaining the same following distance.","You correctly located and opened the door, but you spent many frames stopped in the doorway while holding the handle and keeping the robot at the threshold. After opening the door fully, release the handle sooner and walk forward with the robot so both of you clear the doorway without lingering in the entrance.\n2. At the step/threshold, you pause and let the robot sit partly outside the room before committing. Maintain a steady, confident pace: as soon as the doorway is clear, guide the robot straight over the threshold and continue several steps into the room to avoid blocking the door area.","Your main mistakes were following too closely at the doorway and moving while the door was only partly open. These make it harder for the robot to adjust and can put you at risk at the step.\nStep 1: At the doorway, stay one small step behind robot.\nStep 2: Only follow once door feels fully open and robot moves clearly in.\n\n"

With your left hand keeping a light, steady grip on the guide pole, take two small steps forward so your feet cross the doorway threshold and the robot is just ahead of you inside the room.\n2. Once you and the robot are fully inside and clear of the door swing, release the door handle and let it close or gently pull it shut behind you if needed.","Your main mistakes: you were too close to the robot, and the door was often only partly open. This trapped the robot between you and the door so it could not find a good position to go inside.\n\nStep 1: When the robot stops at the door:\n- Take one small step back from the robot.\n- Feel for the door handle and open it wider.\n\nStep 2: Before you try to follow:\n- Check door by pushing until it stops moving.\n- Keep about one arm length behind the robot."
